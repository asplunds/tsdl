# tsDL - TypeScript as Data Layer

- Native type safety - leverage TS on both client and backend
- Refactor with confidence, tsDL won't let your client be outdated by backend refactorings
- Move fast, tsDL removes most of your API boilerplate
- ~~GraphQL/RESTful~~, tsDL makes your _backend_ a type safe library
- Strict input validation by design - Zod, Yup, Joi, Ajv etc.
- No build step, tsDL does not need special compilation for intellisense

## Introduction

TSDL, short for TypeScript as Data Layer, is a transport layer designed to blur the line between client and server side.
In effect, TSDL aims to make your backend a library with full implicit type safety.
TSDL is an improvement of existing RPC technologies and is designed to make migrating from tRPC painless.

Another aspect of this transport layer is its framework agnostic approach, TSDL is designed to work seamlessly with any client-side framework or application because it does not introduce any framework specific dependencies. To clarify,
TSDL does come with some helpers to integrate better with frameworks. However,
the core library will always be standalone.

## Project folder structure

Make sure your client and server are in close reach of each other.

Example:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="example-app" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="client">
      <FileTree.File name="App.tsx" />
      <FileTree.File name="main.tsx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="server">
      <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="server.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

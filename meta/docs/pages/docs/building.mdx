# Building guide

When building the front-end you might run into issues with incompatable tsconfigs
between the client and server(s).

It's normal for your back-end and front-end to have different configurations.
Since TSDL **never** imports any _runtime_ code from your server,
the issue of the TypeScript compiler type checking server side code can be mitigated.

## How to skip tsc checking server files

<Steps>

### Client side

Make sure your client's `tsconfig.json` has `"compilerOptions.skipLibCheck": true`
and add the _path_ or _package name_ (if you use a monorepo) to the `types` directive in your tsconfig.json.

```jsonc filename="client/tsconfig.json" {4, 7}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    /* ... */
    "skipLibCheck": true
    /* ... */
  },
  "types": ["backend"] // the path or module name to your backend package
}
```

### Server side

Add the following to your back-end's `package.json`.

This will point the `tsc` compiler to the types location instead
of the actual code thereby skipping type checking.

```json filename="backend/package.json" {4,6}
{
  "name": "backend",
  ...
  "types": "dist",
  "scripts": {
    "build:types": "tsc --outDir dist --declaration --emitDeclarationOnly",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

You can build however you want, the important thing is that declaration
files are built somewhere. Therefore, you don't necessarily
need `--emitDeclarationOnly` if you want `.js` files in your output directory.

### Building front-end

1. `npm run build:types` in your back-end
2. `npm run build` in your front-end

This should make the TypeScript compiler skip type
checking your backend since `skipLibCheck` ignores `.d.ts` files.

# Router

## Defining a router

Each key on the router argument is a part of a path.
All the router keys chained together make up the path.
The path always leads a query (or an output) also known as a leaf.

```ts
const router = tsdl.router({
  fruits: tsdl.router({
    fetchOne: tsdl.query(() => "Apple"),
  }),
  weatherForecast: tsdl.query(() => "Sunny"),
});
```

In the above snippet there are two paths.

1. /fruits/fetchOne
2. /weatherForecast

Because TSDL uses TypeScript as a data layer, the inferred router on the client
will be an object where each part of the path is itself a key, mirroring the router
defined on the server:

```ts
const client = {
  fruits: {
    fetchOne: () => string,
  },
  weatherForecast: () => string,
};
```

## What is a route?

In TSDL a route is the last chain of the router value for example

```ts
tsdl
  .input(z.string())
  .use(admin)
  .use(logger)
  .query(() => "I'm a query");
```

The entire above snippet is a _route_. The query is only the `.query` part

A route can be declared elsewhere and still be a route:

```ts
const isAdmin = tsdl.input(z.string()).use(admin).use(logger);

const route = isAdmin.query(() => "I'm a query");
const route2 = isAdmin.query(() => "I'm another query");
```
